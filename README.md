This repository contains the tutorial and source code for creating a simple
gesture or swipe sensor using the Arduino hardware platform.

If you are a teacher wishing to adapt any of these materials for use in
lessons, please contact Ben Marshall, who's details are found at the end of the
tutorial document, or Caroline Higgins who organises the Digimakers events.

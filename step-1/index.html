<h1>Step 1 - Setting Up The Sensor</h1>
<p class="section">
First things first, we need to build the circuit for our gesture sensor.
This section will show you the circuit diagram for you to copy, and also
explain how it works.
</p>

<h2>About The Components</h2>

<div class="section">
<p>
We will be using just two different components to build our gesture sensor!
The first is the Arduino, obviously. The second is called a <i>Light
Dependent Resistor</i> or <i>LDR</i>. It's the one that looks like a little
circle with legs in the picture below.
</p>

<p>
You've probably guessed, that it is a resistor, and that it's <i>resistance</i>
changes depending on how much light we shine on it's face. We can build a
circuit that uses two of these, and detects that one of them has been
covered up.

<h2>Building the circuit.</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
Look at the diagram below...

<p>
Pretty simple eh?
</p>
</div>

<h2>Testing It Out.</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
Now, lets write some code, and work out how our circuit behaves when we
wave at it. The code is shown below:
</p>

<p>
Upload this code to the Arduino, like you did in the 
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/getting-started">getting started</a> section.
Once that has finished, you can use a tool called the <i>Serial Plotter</i>
by going to <b>Tools -> Serial Plotter</b> in the Arduino IDE Menu Bar.
All this does is make a graph of the sensor value we are sending back to the
computer with the <code>Serial.println</code> command.
